\begin{abstract}
Environmental fields can have multiple hotspots or local maxima, and the goal is to determine their characteristics. For example, in a oest denisty estimation task in agriculture, it may be necessary to determine the location, spatial extent, and strength of the global maximum with highest accuracy, yet, it is desirable to determine the other hotspots, possibly with lower accuracy.
